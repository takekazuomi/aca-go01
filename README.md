# README

- [x] deploy container apps from GitHub Action
- [x] use github oidc auth
- [x] use bicep to deploy

## TODO

- The build variable is not the correct git hash. For now, I'm using "--iso-8601" instead.
- In bicep deploy, It is divided into build and deploy, but it doesn't make much sense to clone both.
